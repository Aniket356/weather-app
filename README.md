# Weather App

This is a weather app which shows you the weather of an entered location by fetching it from weather API. I learnt about APIs and fetching requests from servers through this project.  
This project was a part of The Odin Project's curriculum.  
You can check the project out [here](https://aniket356.github.io/weather-app/).
